#When working with classes in Python, the term “self” refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. 
# It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. 
# Whenever you call a method of an object created from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter. 
# This enables you to modify the object’s properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance.
